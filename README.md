# Portfolio-Allocation-of-Stocks
Overview
This Google Colab notebook is designed to demonstrate advanced techniques in stock portfolio optimization, integrating Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), integer programming, linear regression, and Monte Carlo simulation. The goal is to develop a portfolio that balances risk and profit effectively for potential investors.

Features
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Application: Utilizes MPT to identify efficient frontiers for portfolio optimization.
Integer Programming: Implements integer programming to select a combination of stocks that maximizes returns while adhering to budget constraints.
Linear Regression Analysis: Uses regression models to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Applies Monte Carlo simulations to assess risk and estimate the probability of achieving certain returns.

Prerequisites
A Google account to access and run Google Colab notebooks.
Basic understanding of portfolio theory, statistical analysis, and Python programming.
